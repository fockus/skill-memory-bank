# Memory Bank — /mb

The `/mb` command is the single entrypoint for managing project Memory Bank (`.memory-bank/`).

## Subcommands

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

Determine the subcommand from the first word of `$ARGUMENTS`. Remaining words are parameters for that subcommand.

### Routing


| Subcommand                                               | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Subcommand implementation

### Aliases for `/start`, `/done`, `/plan`

`/mb start`, `/mb done`, and `/mb plan` are aliases that dispatch to the canonical commands:

- `/mb start` → see `commands/start.md` (reads Memory Bank, suggests `/mb map` if `codebase/` empty)
- `/mb done` → see `commands/done.md` (MB Manager actualize + note + `.session-lock`)
- `/mb plan <type> <topic>` → see `commands/plan.md` (mb-plan.sh scaffold + fill + mb-plan-sync.sh)

Invoking `/mb start` = invoking `/start` — same scripts, same subagents, same outcome. Do not duplicate the logic here; read the primary command file and follow it.

### context / search / note / tasks

For these subcommands, run the MB Manager subagent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet",
  description="MB Manager: <action>",
  prompt="<contents of ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/agents/mb-manager.md>

action: <action>

<task description and current-session context>"
)
```

Concrete actions:

- **context** / **(empty)**: `action: context` — also delegated to `/start` for consistent behavior
- **search ****: **`action: search <query>` where `query` is the remainder of `$ARGUMENTS` after `search`
- **note ****: **`action: note <topic>` + pass what was done in the current session
- **tasks**: `action: tasks`

### update

Actualize core files using automatic analysis of the current project state.

Unlike `done`, **update** does not create a note and does not require a session summary — the agent analyzes the state directly:

1. **Collect metrics through the language-agnostic script**:

```bash
# Detects the stack (python/go/rust/node/multi), outputs key=value:
#   stack=<stack>
#   test_cmd=<cmd>
#   lint_cmd=<cmd>
#   src_count=<N>
# For an unknown stack it returns empty values with a warning on stderr (does not fail).
# Override via .memory-bank/metrics.sh if you need custom metrics.
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-metrics.sh

# Optional — run tests and capture status:
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-metrics.sh --run

# Git context
git log --oneline -5
git diff --stat HEAD~3 2>/dev/null | tail -5
```

1. **Run MB Manager** with the collected metrics:

```
Agent(
  prompt="<contents of ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/agents/mb-manager.md>

action: actualize

Current metrics from code (from mb-metrics.sh):
- Stack: <detected>
- Tests: <test_status or suggest running them manually>
- Source files: <src_count>
- Lint: <lint output if it was run>
- Recent commits: <git log>
- Changed files: <git diff stat>

Update core files (STATUS metrics, checklist, plan focus) using REAL data from the codebase. Do not rely on the narrative description — verify through grep/find/bash.",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet"
)
```

1. Show the user what was updated.

**Note:** if `mb-metrics.sh` returns `stack=unknown`, warn the user that auto-metrics are unavailable and suggest creating `.memory-bank/metrics.sh` with custom logic (see `references/templates.md`).

### doctor

Diagnose and fix inconsistencies INSIDE Memory Bank.

Run the MB Doctor subagent:

```
Agent(
  prompt="<contents of ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/agents/mb-doctor.md>

action: doctor

Check consistency across all core files in .memory-bank/:
- plan.md statuses vs checklist.md
- STATUS.md metrics vs reality (pytest, source files)
- STATUS.md constraints vs real code
- BACKLOG.md vs plan.md
- progress.md completeness
- plan files in plans/ vs their statuses
- duplicates and stale references",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet"
)
```

Show the report to the user: what was found, what was fixed, and what still needs a decision.

### index

Quick operation, no subagent:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-index.sh
```

Show the result to the user.

### plan

**Alias** for `/plan` — dispatch to `commands/plan.md`. The canonical planning command lives there: mb-plan.sh scaffold → fill with `<!-- mb-stage:N -->` markers + SMART DoD + TDD per stage → mb-plan-sync.sh to reconcile with `checklist.md` + `plan.md`.

Allowed `type` values: `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `experiment`. If `type` is missing, ask the user.

### verify

Plan verification — confirm that code matches the plan, all DoD items are satisfied, and nothing important is missing.

1. Find the active plan in `.memory-bank/plans/` (not in `done/`). If there are several, use the most recent one or the one specified in the arguments.
2. Run the Plan Verifier subagent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet",
  description="Plan Verifier: plan verification",
  prompt="<contents of ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/agents/plan-verifier.md>

Plan file: <path to plan>

Context: <description of current work, which stages are considered complete>"
)
```

1. Get the Plan Verifier report and show it to the user.
2. If there are CRITICAL issues, **fix them** before proceeding.
3. If there are WARNING issues, tell the user and ask whether they should be fixed.

**IMPORTANT:** `/mb verify` is **REQUIRED** before `/mb done` when the work followed a plan. Do not close out a plan without verification.

### map [focus]

Scan the codebase and generate structured MD documents in `.memory-bank/codebase/`.

`focus` values (the first word after `map`):

- `stack` — only `STACK.md` (languages, runtime, integrations)
- `arch` — only `ARCHITECTURE.md` (layers, structure, entrypoints)
- `quality` — only `CONVENTIONS.md` (naming, style, testing)
- `concerns` — only `CONCERNS.md` (tech debt, risks)
- `all` (default, if omitted) — all 4 documents

Run the MB Codebase Mapper subagent:

```
Agent(
  prompt="<contents of ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/agents/mb-codebase-mapper.md>

focus: <stack|arch|quality|concerns|all>

Analyze the current project and write MD documents directly to `.memory-bank/codebase/`. Use `mb-metrics.sh` for stack detection, follow the ≤70-line templates, and return confirmation only.",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet",
  description="MB Codebase Mapper: focus=<focus>"
)
```

**After completion:**

- New/updated Markdown docs live in `.memory-bank/codebase/{STACK,ARCHITECTURE,CONVENTIONS,CONCERNS}.md`
- `/mb context` now automatically shows a one-line summary for each doc
- `/mb context --deep` shows the full contents of codebase documents

Tell the user which documents were created/updated, which stack was detected, and suggest `/mb context --deep` for full context.

### upgrade

Update the skill to the latest version from GitHub. Requires a `git clone` installation.

Flags (the first word after `upgrade`):

- (no flags) — check and apply after confirmation
- `--check` — check only (exit 1 if an update is available, exit 0 if already up to date)
- `--force` — apply without interactive confirmation

Run directly (no subagent — this is a systems-level operation, no LLM needed):

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-upgrade.sh $ARGS_AFTER_UPGRADE
```

The script:

1. Pre-flight: checks that `~/.claude/skills/skill-memory-bank` is a git repo with a clean working tree
2. Reads the `VERSION` file and local commit hash
3. Runs `git fetch origin` and compares local vs remote (`ahead/behind`)
4. Shows pending commits (`git log HEAD..origin/main`)
5. If `--check` is used — exits with a status code
6. If updates exist and `--force` is not used — asks for confirmation
7. On confirmation: `git pull --ff-only` + re-run `install.sh` (idempotent merge of hooks/commands)
8. Prints `local → new` version

**Typical flow:**

```
User: /mb upgrade
→ script fetches, shows: "3 behind, 0 ahead"
→ shows the latest 3 commits
→ asks: "Apply 3 updates? (y/n)"
→ user: y
→ `git pull` + `bash install.sh` → manifest refreshed
→ "Skill updated: 2.0.0-dev (cd65d0a) → 2.1.0 (abc1234)"
```

**Errors:**

- Skill is not a git clone → suggest reinstalling via clone
- Dirty working tree → suggest `git stash` / `git checkout --`
- Divergent branches → suggest manual pull
- Non-interactive mode without `--force` → error

**IMPORTANT:** The skill repo (`~/.claude/skills/skill-memory-bank`) is the canonical source. After `git pull`, `install.sh` must be rerun to refresh host-specific globals, symlink aliases `~/.claude/skills/memory-bank` and `~/.codex/skills/memory-bank`, and the managed block in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. The script does this automatically.

### compact [--dry-run|--apply]

Status-based archival decay. Cleans up old completed plans and unused low-importance notes, **without touching active work**.

**Criteria (AND, not OR):**


| Candidate                              | Age threshold | Done-signal (required)                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan in `plans/done/`                  | `>60d` mtime  | Primary: already physically in `plans/done/`                                                                                            |
| Plan in `plans/*.md` (active location) | `>60d` mtime  | `✅` / `[x]` marker in `checklist.md` line with the basename, OR mention in `progress.md`/`STATUS.md` as `completed|done|closed|shipped` |
| Note in `notes/*.md`                   | `>90d` mtime  | `importance: low` in frontmatter + **no** basename references in `plan.md`/`STATUS.md`/`checklist.md`/`RESEARCH.md`/`BACKLOG.md`        |


**Safety net:** active plans (not done) are **NOT archived** even if >180d old. Instead, emit a warning like "plan X is older than 180d but not done — check whether it is still relevant".

**Effects of `--apply`:**

- Plans → compressed into one line inside `BACKLOG.md ## Archived plans`, original file deleted. Source path is preserved as `(was: plans/done/<file>.md)` — git history keeps the full text.
- Notes → moved to `notes/archive/` + body compressed to 3 non-empty lines + marker `<!-- archived on YYYY-MM-DD -->`. Entries get `archived: true` in `index.json`.
- Touched `.memory-bank/.last-compact` timestamp.

`--dry-run` (default) — prints reasoning per candidate to stdout, 0 file changes.

Run directly (systems-level, no LLM needed for the decision logic — it is deterministic):

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-compact.sh $ARGS_AFTER_COMPACT
```

**Searching the archive:** default `mb-search` does NOT include archived items. Opt in via `mb-search.sh --include-archived <query>` or `--include-archived --tag <tag>`.

**Typical flow:**

```
User: /mb compact
→ dry-run output:
  mode=dry-run
  plans_candidates=2
  notes_candidates=5
  candidates=7

  # Plans to archive:
    archive: plans/done/2026-01-10_feature_x.md (reason=in_done_dir, age=100d)
    archive: plans/done/2026-02-01_fix_auth.md (reason=in_done_dir, age=78d)

  # Notes to archive:
    archive: notes/2025-12-15_experiment.md (reason=low_age_unref, age=125d)
    ...

  # Warnings — active plans older than 180d:
    warning: plans/2025-09-01_long_feature.md is 230d old but not done — check whether it is still relevant

User: /mb compact --apply
→ [apply] archived plan: plans/done/2026-01-10_feature_x.md (reason=in_done_dir)
  [apply] archived note: notes/2025-12-15_experiment.md → notes/archive/
  ...
```

### import --project  [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--apply]

Bootstrap Memory Bank from Claude Code JSONL transcripts. Cold-start in seconds instead of weeks of manual reconstruction.

**Source:** `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl` — Claude Code stores all session transcripts there. The slug is derived from project paths (for example `-Users-fockus-Apps-X` for `/Users/fockus/Apps/X`).

**Extract strategy:**

- `progress.md` — daily-grouped `## YYYY-MM-DD (imported)` sections with a summary (N user turns + M assistant replies + the first 120 chars of the first user prompt)
- `notes/` — heuristic architectural discussions: ≥3 consecutive assistant messages >1K chars → note `YYYY-MM-DD_NN_<topic-slug>.md` with frontmatter `importance: medium`, tags `[imported, discussion]`, body = compressed first + last message

**Safety:**

- `--dry-run` (default) — stdout summary (jsonls/events/days/notes counts), 0 file changes
- `--apply` — performs writes + touches `.memory-bank/.import-state.json`
- **Dedup:** SHA256(timestamp + first 500 chars of text) persisted in state — two consecutive runs are idempotent
- **PII auto-wrap:** email + API key (`sk-...`, `sk-ant-...`, `Bearer <long>`, `gh[pousr]_<long>`) regex → `<private>...</private>`. This intersects with Stage 3 so imported data is protected from leaking into `index.json` / search
- **Resume:** `.import-state.json` stores `seen_hashes` — repeated imports skip already-seen events
- **Broken JSONL line:** skip with warning; continue parsing the rest

Run directly:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-import.py $ARGS_AFTER_IMPORT
```

**Typical cold-start flow:**

```
User: /mb import --project ~/.claude/projects/-Users-fockus-Apps-myproject/ --since 2026-03-01
→ dry-run output:
  jsonls=5
  events=342
  days=18
  notes=12
  mode=dry-run

User: /mb import --project ~/.claude/projects/-Users-fockus-Apps-myproject/ --since 2026-03-01 --apply
→ writes progress.md (18 daily sections) + 12 notes → state saved
  jsonls=5 events=342 days=18 notes=12 mode=apply
```

**Limitations in v2.2:**

- Summarization is currently deterministic (first+last chars), not LLM-based. Haiku-powered compression is backlog for v2.3+ if summary quality proves insufficient
- Debug-session detection for `lessons.md` — TODO (v2.2+)
- `STATUS.md` seed — manual only

### graph [--apply] [src_root]

Build a code graph for the Python part of the project through stdlib `ast` (0 new deps). Replaces `grep` for questions like "where is X called?", "which classes inherit from Y?", "what is imported from model.py?" — deterministic, fast, incremental.

**What it parses:**

- **Nodes:** module (per file), function (top-level + nested), class
- **Edges:** `import` (import X / from Y import Z), `call` (func() / obj.method()), `inherit` (class Child(Parent))

**Output (`--apply`):**

- `<mb>/codebase/graph.json` — JSON Lines (one node/edge per line, grep-friendly, streamable)
- `<mb>/codebase/god-nodes.md` — top 20 nodes by degree (in + out), with `file:line` + kind
- `<mb>/codebase/.cache/<hash>.json` — per-file SHA256 → parsed entities

**Incremental:** if `sha256(file_content)` matches the cache — skip re-parse. On a large repo, the second run is near-instant.

**Safety:**

- `--dry-run` (default) — stdout summary (nodes/edges/reparsed/cached), 0 file changes
- `--apply` — writes all outputs + updates cache
- Broken syntax → skip with warning, batch continues
- `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.*/` — excluded

Run directly:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-codegraph.py $ARGS_AFTER_GRAPH
```

**Typical flow:**

```
User: /mb graph
→ dry-run output:
  nodes=52
  edges=388
  reparsed=3
  cached=0
  mode=dry-run

User: /mb graph --apply
→ nodes=52 edges=388 reparsed=3 cached=0 mode=apply
  [writes codebase/graph.json + god-nodes.md + .cache/]

# Modified 1 file, reran:
User: /mb graph --apply
→ `reparsed=1 cached=2` — one file re-parsed, two loaded from cache
```

**Example top god-nodes (dogfood on this repo):**

```
| # | Name          | Kind     | File:Line            | Degree |
|---|---------------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | run_import    | function | mb-import.py:185     | 60     |
| 2 | main          | function | mb-index-json.py:187 | 23     |
| 3 | _atomic_write | function | mb-import.py:157     | 22     |
```

**Integration with `mb-codebase-mapper`:** the agent uses `graph.json` as the source for CONVENTIONS and CONCERNS instead of grep (backlog for v2.3).

**Language support (v2.2 + Stage 6.5):**

- **Always works** (stdlib `ast`): Python (`.py`)
- **Opt-in** (requires tree-sitter + grammars): Go (`.go`), JavaScript (`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`), TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`), Rust (`.rs`), Java (`.java`)
- Install tree-sitter: `pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-go tree-sitter-javascript tree-sitter-typescript tree-sitter-rust tree-sitter-java`
- Without tree-sitter: non-Python files are silently skipped (graceful degradation). The `HAS_TREE_SITTER` flag in the script reflects the status
- Skipped directories: `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `target`, `dist`, `build`, any `.`*

**Limitations:**

- Type inference is absent — edges work on names only (`foo()` calls do not distinguish modules with the same function name). Name resolution through imports — TODO v2.3+
- Tree-sitter extractor is intentionally simplified (MVP): not all language edge cases are covered — if you notice a missing node, open an issue
- `god-nodes.md` wiki/per-node documentation — deferred (YAGNI until there is real demand)
- C/C++/Ruby/PHP/Kotlin/Swift are not supported (can be added on demand via a new entry in `_TS_LANG_CONFIG`)

### deps [--install-hints]

Check all required and optional skill dependencies. This runs automatically before `install.sh` (step 0) and is also available standalone via `/mb deps`.

**Required (exit 1 if missing):**

- `bash` — runtime for shell scripts
- `python3` — required by `mb-index-json.py`, `mb-import.py`, `mb-codegraph.py`, and hooks
- `jq` — required by `session-end-autosave.sh`, `block-dangerous.sh`, `file-change-log.sh` (JSON parsing from hook stdin)
- `git` — required by `mb-upgrade.sh` and version tracking

**Optional (warning, not a blocker):**

- `rg` (ripgrep) — speeds up `mb-search`, with fallback to `grep`
- `shellcheck` — dev-only (CI lint)
- `tree_sitter` (Python package) + grammars — multi-language `/mb graph` (Go/JS/TS/Rust/Java). Without it, only Python works
- `PyYAML` — strict YAML parsing in frontmatter, with fallback to the simple parser

**Output format** (key=value, machine-parseable):

```
dep_bash=ok
dep_python3=ok
dep_jq=missing
dep_git=ok
...
deps_required_missing=1
deps_optional_missing=2
```

**Install hints** — `--install-hints` prints OS-specific commands (brew/apt/dnf/pacman detected via `/etc/os-release`).

Run directly:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-deps-check.sh $ARGS_AFTER_DEPS
```

**Typical first-install flow:**

```
User: bash install.sh
→ [0/7] Dependency check
  ❌ dep_jq=missing
  ═══ Required tools missing — install before proceeding ═══
    jq: brew install jq
  Exit 1

User: brew install jq && bash install.sh
→ [0/7] ✅ All required dependencies present.
  [1/7] Rules → ...continues
```

**Override:** `MB_SKIP_DEPS_CHECK=1 bash install.sh` — skips preflight (CI / isolated environments where tools are checked differently).

### help [subcommand]

Help for `/mb` subcommands. Single source of truth — reads `~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/commands/mb.md` directly.

**Modes (first word after `help`):**

1. `**/mb help`** (no argument) — print the router table of all subcommands with one-line descriptions.
2. `**/mb help <subcommand>**` — extract and show the detailed implementation block for that subcommand (sections like `### <subcommand>`).

**Algorithm for the agent:**

```bash
SKILL_MD="$HOME/.claude/skills/memory-bank/commands/mb.md"
SUB="$SUBCOMMAND_ARG"  # first word after "help"; may be empty

SKILL_MD="$SKILL_MD" SUB="$SUB" python3 - <<'PY'
import os, sys
path = os.environ["SKILL_MD"]
sub = os.environ.get("SUB", "").strip()
lines = open(path, encoding="utf-8").read().splitlines()

if not sub:
    # Mode 1: router table — between "### Routing" and the next "---"
    in_section = False
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith("### Routing"):
            in_section = True
            continue
        if in_section and line.startswith("---"):
            break
        if in_section:
            print(line)
    print("\nDetails: /mb help <subcommand>  (e.g. /mb help compact)")
    sys.exit(0)

# Mode 2: extract "### SUB" block (exact, space-after, or bracket-after)
header = f"### {sub}"
in_block = False
for line in lines:
    is_header = line == header or line.startswith(header + " ") or line.startswith(header + "[")
    if is_header:
        in_block = True
        print(line)
        continue
    if in_block and line.startswith("### "):
        break
    if in_block and line.rstrip() == "---":
        break
    if in_block:
        print(line)
PY
```

**Examples:**

```
User: /mb help
→ prints the router table with 18 subcommands

User: /mb help compact
→ prints the full section "### compact [--dry-run|--apply]" with logic,
  examples, and limitations

User: /mb help tags
→ prints the section "### tags [--apply] [--auto-merge]"
```

**Do not confuse with:**

- `/help` — built-in Claude Code command (not a skill).
- `commands/catchup.md` / `commands/start.md` / `commands/done.md` — standalone top-level slash commands (lightweight), not `/mb` subcommands.

### init [--minimal|--full]

Initialize Memory Bank in a new project.

**Modes** (first word after `init`):

- `--minimal` — only `.memory-bank/` structure + core files. For advanced users who will write `CLAUDE.md` themselves.
- `--full` (default, if no flag is provided) — `.memory-bank/` + `RULES.md` copy + stack auto-detect + `CLAUDE.md` generation + optional `.planning/` symlink prompt.

---

#### Step 1: Create the structure

```bash
mkdir -p .memory-bank/{experiments,plans/done,notes,reports,codebase}
```

Core files (templates — `~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/references/templates.md`):

- `STATUS.md` — project header, "Current phase: Start"
- `plan.md` — "Current focus: define", `## Active plan` section with markers `<!-- mb-active-plan -->` / `<!-- /mb-active-plan -->` (for auto-sync)
- `checklist.md` — empty checklist
- `RESEARCH.md` — header + empty hypothesis table
- `BACKLOG.md` — header + empty sections (HIGH/LOW ideas, ADRs)
- `progress.md` — header
- `lessons.md` — header

**If `--minimal` — stop here.** Report `[MEMORY BANK: INITIALIZED]` + a hint to run `/mb start`.

---

#### Step 1.5: Offer to populate `codebase/` (`--full` only)

Before continuing to RULES and stack detection, ask the user whether the skill should seed `.memory-bank/codebase/` now via the `mb-codebase-mapper` subagent:

```
Populate .memory-bank/codebase/ with STACK / ARCHITECTURE / CONVENTIONS / CONCERNS?
This launches the `mb-codebase-mapper` subagent (sonnet) with focus=all.
Default: skip — you can run `/mb map` anytime later.
(y/N)
```

If the answer is `y`, run the subagent exactly as documented in `### map [focus]` with `focus: all`. If the answer is `N` or empty, skip and continue to Step 2 — never auto-invoke the mapper. The folder stays empty; `/mb start` will suggest `/mb map` on the next session if still empty.

---

#### Step 2: Copy RULES (`--full` only)

```bash
cp ~/.claude/RULES.md .memory-bank/RULES.md
# If it already exists — compare via diff and ask the user before overwriting
```

---

#### Step 3: Auto-detect the stack (`--full` only)

Run `mb-metrics.sh` to detect the stack, then enrich it with more detailed information:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-metrics.sh
# → stack, test_cmd, lint_cmd, src_count
```

Augment with framework information (grep imports/deps):

- Python: FastAPI, Django, Flask (pyproject.toml + imports)
- Node: Next.js, Express, Nest (package.json deps)
- Go: gin, echo, fiber (go.mod)
- Frontend: React/Vue/Angular/Svelte + FSD layers (check `src/app/`, `src/pages/`, `src/features/`, `src/entities/`, `src/shared/`)

Store the results: `{LANGUAGE}`, `{FRAMEWORK}`, `{STRUCTURE}`, `{TOOLS}`.

---

#### Step 4: Generate `CLAUDE.md` (`--full` only)

Use the template from `~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/references/claude-md-template.md`. Fill in `{LANGUAGE}`, `{FRAMEWORK}`, `{TOOLS}`, project structure, and key dependencies.

Required sections in generated `CLAUDE.md`:

- **Project** — name and description
- **Technology Stack** — languages, runtime, frameworks, package manager
- **Conventions** — naming patterns (detect from existing code), code style
- **Architecture** — for backend: Clean Architecture dependency direction; for frontend: FSD layers
- **Rules** — link to `~/.claude/RULES.md` + `.memory-bank/RULES.md` + short critical rules (TDD, Contract-First, Clean Arch/FSD, SOLID thresholds, coverage)
- **Memory Bank** — `/mb` command and key files

**Show the user the draft before writing it.** Ask: "Write CLAUDE.md? Anything to add or change?"

---

#### Step 5: `.planning/` symlink (`--full` only, optional)

If `.planning/` already exists (from GSD or other tools) and `.memory-bank/.planning/` does not exist:

```
I suggest moving `.planning/` inside `.memory-bank/`:
  mv .planning .memory-bank/.planning
  ln -s .memory-bank/.planning .planning

This keeps project artifacts in one directory.
The symlink preserves GSD compatibility.

Do this? (y/n)
```

If `y` — execute it. If `n` — leave everything as-is.

---

#### Step 6: Summary

Print:

- Created files: `.memory-bank/` + `CLAUDE.md` (if `--full`)
- Detected stack: `{language}`, `{framework}`, `{tools}`
- Report: `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`
- Suggest the next steps:
  - `/mb start` — load context in subsequent sessions
  - `/mb map` — populate `.memory-bank/codebase/` (STACK / ARCHITECTURE / CONVENTIONS / CONCERNS) if skipped in Step 1.5
  - (if the project needs planning) `/mb plan feature "<topic>"`

---

### install []

Install Memory Bank for the current project + selected AI agents. The CLI can be run from Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and other agents with a Bash tool, but native `/mb` command surface is guaranteed only for Claude Code / OpenCode. In Codex, installation provides global skill registration + `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` hints, not a separate slash-command surface.

**Argument format** (first word after `install`):

- Empty → interactive selection.
- Comma/space-separated client list (for example `claude-code,cursor,windsurf`) → direct run without prompt.
- `all` → all 8 clients.

Allowed names: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `kilo`, `opencode`, `pi`, `codex`.

---

#### Step 1 — Check the CLI

```bash
command -v memory-bank >/dev/null 2>&1 && memory-bank version
```

If not found — tell the user and suggest:

```
memory-bank CLI not found. Install it using one of:

  pipx install memory-bank-skill           # cross-platform
  brew install fockus/tap/memory-bank      # macOS / Linuxbrew
  pip install memory-bank-skill            # alternative

Then retry installation via CLI `memory-bank install ...` or the matching host command where supported.
```

Then stop.

---

#### Step 2 — Collect the client list

**If `$ARGUMENTS` (after the word `install`) is non-empty** — use it directly. The CLI validates it.

**If empty:**

In **Claude Code**, use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`:

```
question: "Which AI coding agents should share this project's memory bank?"
header: "Clients"
options:
  - {label: "claude-code (recommended)", description: "Primary Claude Code setup"}
  - {label: "cursor", description: "Cursor 1.7+ with CC-compat hooks"}
  - {label: "windsurf", description: "Windsurf Cascade hooks"}
  - {label: "opencode + codex + pi (shared AGENTS.md)", description: "All three use AGENTS.md — refcount-tracked"}
```

If the user chose "opencode + codex + pi" — expand it into `opencode,codex,pi`.

If the user selected nothing — default to `claude-code`.

In **other agents without `AskUserQuestion`**, print the list and ask for input:

```
Which agents should share this project's memory bank?
  [1] claude-code (recommended)
  [2] cursor
  [3] windsurf
  [4] cline
  [5] kilo
  [6] opencode
  [7] pi
  [8] codex

Reply with names or numbers (e.g. "1,2" or "cursor,windsurf"),
'all' for every client, or press Enter for claude-code only.
```

Parse the reply into a comma-separated list of names.

---

#### Step 3 — Run installation

```bash
memory-bank install --clients "<selected-list>" --project-root "$PWD"
```

Show stdout — the CLI prints a step-by-step report (Rules / Agents / Hooks / Commands / Settings / Manifest + cross-agent adapters).

---

#### Step 4 — Resume hint

After success:

```
✓ Memory Bank installed for: <clients>
  Project root: <PWD>

Next steps:
  • Initialize the memory bank:   /mb init
  • Load context in this session: /mb start
  • Plan a feature:               /mb plan feature <topic>
```

If the installed client list includes one different from the current host (for example the user in Claude Code chose `cursor`) — remind them that the adapter will be picked up automatically when that IDE next opens the project.

---

**Errors:**

- `memory-bank: command not found` → see Step 1.
- `invalid client 'X'` → check the name (strict list of 8).
- `bash not found on PATH` (Windows) → suggest Git for Windows or WSL.

**Do not confuse with:**

- `/mb init` — initializes `.memory-bank/` **inside** the project after the skill is installed globally. Usually `install` → then `init`.
- `install.sh` in the repo root — the shell script that `memory-bank install` calls under the hood.

---

## General Rules

- If `.memory-bank/` does not exist and the command is not `init` — report `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` and suggest `/mb init`
- After execution — show the user a short result summary
- progress.md = APPEND-ONLY
- Numbering is global: H-NNN, EXP-NNN, ADR-NNN
